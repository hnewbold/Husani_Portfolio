## Featured Projects

### 1. Predicting Employee Attrition with Deep Learning: An Artificial Neural Network (ANN) Approach using TensorFlow
This project involves developing an Artificial Neural Network to predict which employees are likely to leave the company based on various factors such as tenure, salary, and working hours. The project illustrates the power of deep learning models in extracting patterns and making accurate predictions. Additionally, it demonstrates the use of Keras Tuner for efficient hyperparameter tuning.

### 2. Hotel Review Sentiment Analysis with Large Language Models (LLM): Leveraging BERT in TensorFlow
This project analyzes the sentiment of hotel reviews using advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The reviews are cleaned using the Natural Language Toolkit (nltk) to remove noise and standardize the text. A pre-trained BERT model, accessed through the Hugging Face Transformers library, is fine-tuned using the cleaned hotel review data. The result is a fine-tuned BERT model implemented in TensorFlow that can accurately predict the sentiment (positive, neutral, or negative) of hotel reviews.
