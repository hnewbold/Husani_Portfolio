# Husani Newbold's Data Science Portfolio

Welcome to my data science portfolio! Here you will find a growing selection of my personal machine learning projects.

## Featured Projects

### 1. Predicting Employee Attrition with Deep Learning: An Artificial Neural Network (ANN) Approach using TensorFlow
This project involves developing an Artificial Neural Network to predict which employees are likely to leave the company based on various factors such as tenure, salary, and working hours. The project illustrates the power of deep learning models in extracting patterns and making accurate predictions. Additionally, it demonstrates the use of Keras Tuner for efficient hyperparameter tuning.
